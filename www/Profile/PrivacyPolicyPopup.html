<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Effective
  Date of Last Revision: January _, 2016</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>1. Introduction.</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Erge respects your privacy and the privacy of any information you may
  choose to share with us or which is automatically transmitted to us
  from your network. Erge is committed to protecting that information
  as outlined in detail below. The following policy has been
  implemented by Erge to protect your private information. In
  addition, when you use the Erge Website, the Erge Mobile App, or
  products or services provided thereby (“Erge,” the “Service,”
  or the “System”), you will be subject to the following terms and
  conditions.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>2. Information
  We Collect When You Use Erge</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Erge receives and stores any information you provide. This includes
  information that can identify you (“Personal Identifiable
  Information” or “Private Information”). Personally Identifiable
  Information (PII) is any data that could potentially identify you, a
  specific individual. This includes your first and last name,
  telephone number, postal and email addresses (“Name and Address”),
  or credit card numbers, cardholder names, and expiration dates
  (“Billing Information”). We may also request information about
  your preferences regarding people who would like to have items
  delivered for them (“Service Requestors” or “Requestors”),
  and people who would like to participate by delivering these items
  (“Service Providers” or “Providers”) (“Service
  Preferences”). We may, at our discretion, share Name and Address
  information and Service Preferences with affiliated entities,
  business partners, and other independent third-party sources. Billing
  Information will only be shared as necessary to pay Providers when a
  task is completed. You can choose not to provide some or all of this
  Private Information to us. However, in general, some Private
  Information about you is required in order for you to register as a
  member, request a task, complete a task, complete your profile,
  participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes, ask us a question,
  or initiate other transactions using the services Erge provides.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  The information we collect may not be limited to you. For example,
  when you involve another person in requesting a task or completing a
  task, we will ask for personal information and user preferences about
  that individual. You should obtain the consent of these other
  individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and
  travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information
  may be available only through your account.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  We may also obtain both Private Information, and information about
  you that is not private from affiliated entities, business partners
  and other independent third-party sources. We may add it to our
  account information, some of which may or may not be made available
  to you as you use Erge. Some examples of this kind of information
  include: Updated delivery and address information, purchase history,
  and demographic information. In addition, if you access our accounts
  via a social media account, or use other Erge social media features,
  we may access information about you via that social media provider in
  accordance with the provider's policies. The information may include
  your name, email address, profile picture, gender, list of friends,
  and other information that you authorize us to receive. Depending on
  the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access
  information that you provide to a social media provider regarding
  your respective locations (&quot;Location Data&quot;) to provide you
  with relevant content. Please note that your Location Data may also
  be shared with your friends on a social media provider in accordance
  with your privacy settings for that social media provider.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  The System automatically collects some information about your
  computer that is not Private Information when you use it (“Anonymous
  Information”). This Anonymous Information is available to us as a
  natural result of your use of the technology required to access Erge.
  For example, we will collect your IP address, information about web
  browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer),
  information about your mobile device that you have allowed the device
  to share with us, and information about referring websites or past
  browsing history made available by your browser. We also may collect
  information about patterns of online activity you may engage in at
  Erge, such as information about the tasks you have requested or tasks
  you have performed for others, but without specific reference to you
  personally. We use this Anonymous Information to customize your user
  experience and we may, at our discretion, share Anonymous Information
  we have collected about you with affiliated entities, business
  partners, and other independent third-parties.

  Email Communications</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Erge may send you email messages from time to time that contain
  information about improvements to the System, or about opportunities
  to use the System you have taken advantage of in the past, or that we
  think you might be interested in for the future. Each email we send
  will provide you with the opportunity to choose not to receive these
  email messages in the future.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>5. Sharing
  Information</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  We may share the information we collect about you as described in
  this Privacy Statement or as described at the time of collection or
  sharing, with the following types of entities:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  a. Service providers, such as other Erge users who may be interested
  in completing your tasks, courier services, delivery services, taxi
  or limousine companies, and any other service provider Erge may
  collaborate with to operate and improve the service and fulfill your
  needs for completion of specific tasks. Throughout this site, all
  services provided by a third-party Supplier are described as such. By
  posting a task, or by offering to complete a task using Erge, you are
  authorizing us to disclose to the specific Providers the information
  required to complete the task and deliver the goods or services for
  you. By accepting a task on your behalf, they have agreed to these
  Terms. However, these providers are not controlled by Erge.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  b. Third-party payment transaction vendors who provide services or
  functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business
  analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or
  sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize
  third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including
  as necessary to operate features of our service or to facilitate the
  delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests.
  Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only
  as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share
  or use the information for any other purpose. They are also required
  to follow the same data security practices that we ourselves adhere
  to.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  c. Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or
  services, or whose products or services may be offered as part of our
  service. When a third party is involved in a product or service you
  have requested, their logo or name will appear, either alone or with
  ours. If you choose to access the services they provide, we may share
  information about you with those partners. This information may
  include Personal Information such as your Name and Address. Although
  we only collaborate with reputable and responsible businesses, Erge
  does not control, and is not responsible for, the privacy practices
  of these third-party business partners.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  d. Referring websites or other entities. If you were referred to Erge
  from another app, website, or service, we may share some information
  about you with that referring website. Erge does not control, and is
  not responsible for, the privacy practices of these referring
  entities.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  e. Government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, or
  other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to
  defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such
  cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or
  right available to us.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  f. Third party investigative services when we believe it is
  appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
  or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights,
  property, or safety of our company or the Service, our customers, or
  others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other
  agreements.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  g. Individuals or companies seeking to purchase some or all of Erge
  in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture,
  merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of
  bankruptcy.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal
  information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will
  have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>6. Accessing
  Your Information</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Your contact information may be updated by accessing your profile
  using the System. Your account can be closed by contacting an Erge
  representative at the email address listed below. After you close an
  account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your
  Personal Information. However, you can open a new account at any
  time. Erge may retain information associated with your account for
  analytical purposes as well as for record keeping integrity.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>7. Choosing
  How You Want Your Information to be Used</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  As discussed above, you can choose not to provide us with any
  information, although it will likely reduce the System’s ability to
  provide services to you. For example, without providing certain
  personal information, you will not be able to post a task, nor will
  you be able to agree to perform one. You also can add or update your
  account information, or you can close your account as described
  above. You will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from
  commercial emails in any such message that we send you. If you are a
  registered member, you can also modify your choice at any time.
  Please note that we reserve the right to send you other
  communications, including service announcements, administrative
  messages, and surveys relating either to your account or to
  transactions you have entered into, without offering you the
  opportunity to opt out of receiving them. The Service may allow you
  to provide a mobile number in order to receive various alerts via SMS
  text message. You may discontinue these alerts at any time.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>8. Cookies
  and Other Browser Technology</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Cookies are small text files sent from our System to your browser.
  They can be stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser
  permits). The Service uses cookies for the following general
  purposes:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  a. To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save
  and remember any preferences that may have been set while your
  browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our
  site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information so
  that you will not need to log into our site each time you visit. We
  also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box
  entitled &quot;Sign me in automatically next time.&quot; Please note
  that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data
  included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. Unless
  you register with us, these cookies will not contain any personal
  information.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  b. To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to
  you on this website and possibly on other sites across the Internet.
  For example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie is
  automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to
  recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present
  you with information and advertising based on your apparent
  interests.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  c. To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features
  and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by
  determining which emails you open and act upon).</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  d. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how
  to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
  browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
  cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies,
  you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered by the
  Service.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  e. In addition to the above cookies, we may use Local Shared Objects,
  also referred to as “flash cookies,” on the Site. These are used
  to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user
  preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in
  connection with animated content on our website. Local Shared Objects
  are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than
  simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the
  data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access
  Personal Information that you have provided on this site, and cannot
  be accessed by other websites.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  f. This site may also use clear gifs, pixel tags or “Web bugs”,
  which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function
  to cookies, that are placed in the code of a page. We use these
  systems for a variety of reasons such as to monitor the traffic
  patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to
  deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
  come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a
  third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may
  allow our service providers to use similar monitoring systems to help
  us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to
  track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us
  measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>9. Advertising</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  We may, through cookies and other technologies, collect information
  about your task-related searches, such as what kind of tasks you tend
  to look for, and what, if any, tasks you have requested. We may, at
  our discretion, use this information, together with other information
  we have collected about you, to serve you with ads that match your
  apparent interests. The advertisements you may see when using the
  System are served by us or by our service providers. We may allow
  third parties to collect information about your online activities
  through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include
  (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or
  interact with one of their advertisements on our sites; and (2)
  advertising networks, which collect information about your interests
  when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place
  on many different websites on the Internet.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or

  about your interests, and the information practices of these third
  parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>10. Mobile
  Apps</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  When you use our Mobile App (e.g. for a smart phone or tablet), we
  collect and use information about you in the same way and for the
  same purposes as we do when you use our online services via a web
  browser. In addition to this, we also use some other information that
  we collect automatically when you use our Mobile Apps. Specifically:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><A NAME="_GoBack"></A>
  We may collect information about Mobile App functionality that you
  access and use. This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile
  App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and
  continuously improve the Mobile App. The information we collect for
  this purpose does not enable us to directly identify you.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Each Mobile App also sends us the device's Unique Identification
  Number (or &quot;UID&quot;), a sequence of numbers or characters that
  are unique to your mobile device. We use this only on the first
  opening of the Mobile App so that we can confirm to our advertising
  networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their
  respective ad banners and other marketing tools.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  When you use a Mobile App, you can choose to allow access to your
  current location – provided by your mobile device using Global
  Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology, cell tower triangulation, or
  similar technologies – in order to identify nearby Erge users with
  tasks you may be interested in completing or nearby Erge users who
  are interested in providing concierge services. If you choose to
  allow access, this location data may be collected as part of the
  Anonymous Information we collect about your use of the Service. You
  can switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at any time
  through your phone settings menu.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the
  event that it crashes or hangs. This enables us to investigate the
  error and to improve the stability of our Mobile App for future
  releases. As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us
  information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the
  time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the
  application when the error occurred. We do not use this information
  for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  You always have the ability to control what information a Mobile App
  sends to us. You can exercise this control either by changing the
  settings of the Mobile App under its setting menu or changing the
  settings of your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the
  Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access the System
  through the website.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><U>11. Protecting
  Your Information</U></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  Erge is committed to maintaining the privacy of your information and
  will treat the privacy of your information with the same or greater
  security protections as Erge provides for its own private
  information. While no website can guarantee security, we have
  implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical
  security procedures to help protect the personal information you
  provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted
  to access Personal Information, and they may only do so for permitted
  business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting
  Personal Information or Billing Information between your computer or
  mobile device and system, and we employ firewalls and intrusion
  detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining
  access to your information.</P>

  The System does not offer services directed to children. Children
  under the age of 18 are not allowed to establish accounts on the
  System, and any users we believe to be under 18 can have their

  her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her
  Personal Information.
