  Welcome to Erge, a service that allows a user to perform concierge
  services for other users. By creating a user account on the Erge
  website or the Erge App (the “Service” or “System”), by
  posting a specific task or tasks be performed (a “Task”), using
  the Service to find someone to perform the Task (a “Service
  Provider”), or using the Service to look for Tasks to perform for
  others (“Service Requestors”), you represent and warrant that you
  have read, understand and agree to be bound by this User Agreement.
  Erge reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify,
  add, or delete portions of this User Agreement at any time without
  further notice.  In such an event, Erge will post the changes to the
  User Agreement on Erge and will indicate at the top the date the User
  Agreement was last revised.  Your continued use of the Service after
  any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new User
  Agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this User
  Agreement or any future version thereof, do not use or access (or
  continue to use or access) the Service.  It is your responsibility to
  regularly check the Service to determine if there have been changes
  to the User Agreement and to review such changes.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">PLEASE
  READ THIS USER AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT
  INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS.
  THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, AND A DISPUTE
  RESOLUTION CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS HOW DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED. YOUR

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">Erge
  operates for the benefit of people who would like to have items
  delivered for them (“Service Requestors” or “Requestors”),
  and for the benefit of those who would like to participate by
  delivering these items (“Service Providers” or “Providers”).
  To summarize, the Service generally operates as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
    A Requestor uses the Service to post a request for services the
    Requestor would like performed (a “Task”).</P>
  <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
    Erge users may search for or be notified by the Service that the
    Task is available.</P>
  <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
    A Provider accepts the Task posted by the Requestor, and the
    Requestor agrees to let the Provider perform the Task.</P>
  <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
    The Provider performs the Task, which generally entails obtaining an
    item or items requested in the Task for the Requestor.</P>
  <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
    The Provider then presents the Requestor with the item or items.</P>
  <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
    The Requestor pays Erge for the Task. A portion of this amount is
    retained by Erge, the remainder is paid to the Provider.</P>
  <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
    The Requestor and the Provider may rate each other and offer
    feedback which is then shared with other users.</P>

  You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you
  for the services or goods you receive by a Provider (“Charges”).
  After you have received services through your use of the Service,
  Erge will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf
  of the Provider as the Provider’s limited payment collection agent.
  Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as
  payment made directly by you to the Provider. Charges may include
  applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final
  and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Erge.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by
  Erge using the preferred payment method designated in your Account,
  after which Erge will send you a receipt by email. If your primary
  Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or
  otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Erge may, as the
  Provider 's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment
  method in your Account, if available.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  As between you and Erge, Erge reserves the right to establish, remove
  and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained
  through the use of the Services at any time in Erge's sole
  discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges
  applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially
  during times of high demand. Erge will use reasonable efforts to
  inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be
  responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of
  your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Erge may from
  time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and
  discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same
  or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the
  Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts,
  unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use
  of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to
  cancel your request for services or goods from a Provider at any time
  prior to such Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a
  cancellation fee.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
  This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Provider
  for the services or goods provided. Erge does not designate any
  portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Provider. Any
  representation by Erge (on Erge's website, in the Application, or in
  Erge's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is
  “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the
  payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to
  suggest that Erge provides any additional amounts, beyond those
  described above, to the Provider . You understand and agree that,
  while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any
  Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the
  Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are
  voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through
  the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience
  and leave additional feedback about your Requestor or Provider.</P>
